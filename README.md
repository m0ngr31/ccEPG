# About
This allows you to fetch EPG data for linear streaming services such as Peacock and ABC, and transforms them so you can use them with [chrome-capture-for-channels](https://github.com/fancybits/chrome-capture-for-channels).

# Using
The server exposes 2 main endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| /channels.m3u | The channel list you'll import into your client |
| /xmltv.xml | The schedule that you'll import into your client |

The recommended way of running is to pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/m0ngr31/ccEPG).
